# Dr. Fraudsworth's Finance Factory

## What This Is

A gamified DeFi protocol on Solana featuring a three-token system (CRIME, FRAUD, PROFIT) designed to generate persistent trading volume and SOL-denominated yield through a closed-loop market structure. The system avoids ponzinomics by funding yield exclusively from real trading friction -- asymmetric taxes, a soft peg mechanism, and controlled chaos ("Carnage") create a self-correcting equilibrium between arbitrageurs and yield holders.

The frontend is an explorable steampunk factory scene where 6 clickable machines open themed modal interfaces for all protocol features -- swapping, staking, Carnage monitoring, wallet connection, documentation, and settings. A dedicated /launch page provides the token distribution interface with dual bonding curves, real-time progress gauges, and conditional refund UI. The factory scene IS the navigation layer on desktop; mobile users get a steampunk-themed vertical nav with full feature parity. The visual layer uses zero npm dependencies beyond Next.js Image and Tailwind v4 -- CSS-only animations, custom modal system, and optimized WebP assets.

## Current State

The complete protocol (7 on-chain programs + frontend) is live on Solana devnet, fully security-hardened across 3 independent audits (SOS adversarial, BOK formal verification, VulnHunter variant analysis). All 57 v1.3 hardening requirements are satisfied. The frontend is polished with steampunk component kit, real-time webhook+SSE data pipeline, mobile responsive layout with deep-link wallet adapter, and environment-aware mainnet configuration. Documentation is rewritten code-first. The protocol is ready for v1.4: final devnet lifecycle test and mainnet deployment.

## Core Value

Real SOL yield from real trading friction -- not ponzinomics. Every on-chain program is spec-driven, security-tested, and CPI-validated before integration. The documentation remains the source of truth; every conflict resolved and every gap filled prevents cascading failures.

### Active

## Current Milestone: v1.4 Pre-Mainnet

**Goal:** Complete dress rehearsal — fresh devnet deploy as exact mainnet replica, test both bonding curve pathways (failure + success), Squads multisig authority transfer, exhaustive E2E testing, and production-ready documentation. By the end, mainnet deploy is just "push the button."

**Target features:**
- Deploy infrastructure: canonical deployment.json config system, credential rotation, deploy pipeline generates + verifies config
- Token metadata: Arweave upload with logos, website, X link for all 3 mints
- Bonding curve devnet deadline feature flag (~30 min for testing)
- Pathway 1: Failure path — partial deploy, buy/sell, let expire, refund UI verification
- Pathway 2: Full clean-room deploy — all 7 programs, mints, pools, ALT, whitelist, crank from scratch
- Pathway 2: Graduation + full E2E — fill curves, graduate, trading, taxes, epochs, VRF, carnage, staking, yield
- Squads 2-of-3 multisig on devnet — authority transfer, timelocked upgrade test, documented mainnet procedure
- Mainnet deployment checklist — exhaustive, nothing missed
- Nextra docs rewrite — page by page, illustrated diagrams, production-accurate
- Fix DEPLOY-GAP-01 (BcAdminConfig pipeline automation)

**Hands-on protocol:** Every wave manually verified before starting and after completion. No autonomous decisions.

### Future

(None — v1.4 is the final pre-mainnet milestone)

### Backlog

(Cleared — all items in Active or Out of Scope)

### Out of Scope

- External integrations beyond Switchboard VRF -- minimize attack surface
- WebGL / Three.js 3D scene -- 2D CSS achieves the goal without complexity/device requirements
- Complex particle physics -- stylized CSS animations preferred
- SFX triggers (per-interaction sounds) -- user decided not to pursue
- Music ducking during SFX -- user decided not to pursue
- Ambient factory animations (steam, bubbling, gears) -- user decided not to pursue
- Guided spotlight tour -- protocol is simple enough, not needed
- Emergency pause mechanism -- trust tradeoff, admin pause perceived as rug pull vector
- Vanity program addresses -- have vanity mint CAs (cRiME, FraUd, pRoFiT), program addresses don't need branding

Frontend deployed at: https://dr-fraudsworth-production.up.railway.app

**14-Document Specification Set:**
- DrFraudsworth_Overview.md
- AMM_Implementation.md
- Bonding_Curve_Spec.md
- Carnage_Fund_Spec.md
- Epoch_State_Machine_Spec.md
- New_Yield_System_Spec.md (staking-based)
- Protocol_Initialzation_and_Launch_Flow.md
- Soft_Peg_Arbitrage_Spec.md
- Tax_Pool_Logic_Spec.md
- Transfer_Hook_Spec.md
- Token_Program_Reference.md
- SolanaSetup.md
- VRF_Implementation_Reference.md
- VRF_Migration_Lessons.md

**Key Architectural Constraints:**
- CPI depth-4 limit for Carnage execution (at Solana maximum)
- Two-instruction atomic bundle for VRF + Carnage
- WSOL as SPL Token requires special handling in T22/SPL mixed pools
- 14-entry transfer hook whitelist (Transfer_Hook_Spec.md Section 4 is authoritative)
- Address Lookup Table required for Carnage Sell path (23 named + 8 remaining accounts)

**v3 Reference:**
- archive-V3 branch contains working Switchboard VRF implementation (captured in VRF docs)
- v3 approach was CPI-based (deprecated); v4 uses Switchboard On-Demand client-side pattern

## Constraints

- **Tech Stack**: Anchor/Rust for on-chain programs, Token-2022 standard -- non-negotiable
- **Security**: Crypto is dangerous; every spec must consider attack vectors
- **No Single Source of Truth**: Per the Overview doc, any conflict discovered must be resolved explicitly across all affected documents before proceeding
- **Token Program Compatibility**: Must handle both Token-2022 and SPL Token (WSOL) in pool implementations
- **CPI Depth**: Carnage execution at depth 4 (Solana limit) -- no room for additional CPI layers

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Documentation-first rebuild | v3 failed due to unvalidated architectural assumption; validate specs before code | ✓ Good -- 24 gaps found and fixed before writing any code |
| Iterative convergence process | Single-pass review insufficient; new docs may introduce new conflicts | ✓ Good -- 3 clean passes achieved, documentation stable |
| Document VRF learnings from v3 | Working implementation exists but knowledge isn't captured in specs | ✓ Good -- 736-line reference + 258-line lessons doc created |
| All spec discrepancies resolved as SPEC | v4 follows spec intent, not v3 shortcuts; 7 discrepancies reviewed | ✓ Good -- clean separation between spec intent and implementation pattern |
| Two-instruction atomic bundle for VRF+Carnage | Compute budget concerns resolved by splitting into 2 instructions in same tx | ✓ Good -- documented in Carnage Section 9.5 |
| Token naming: CRIME/FRAUD/PROFIT | Replace placeholder IPA/IPB/OP4 with thematic names | ✓ Good -- zero old names remain in active docs |
| Yield model: passive -> staking-based | Staking requirement adds utility to PROFIT token | ✓ Good -- old spec archived, all references updated |
| 14-category coverage framework | Systematic gap detection across all specs | ✓ Good -- caught 24 gaps including CPI depth-4 limit |
| Foundation doc boost (+1 severity) | Foundation document issues cascade to all dependents | ✓ Good -- prioritized critical fixes first |
| 13-entry whitelist (Transfer_Hook_Spec.md authoritative) | Carnage needs 2 vaults, curves need 2 vaults, reserve whitelisted | ✓ Good -- user-confirmed, consistent across all docs |
| One program per milestone | Limits blast radius when specs meet reality; each program tested in isolation | ✓ Good -- v0.2-v0.6 all proved pattern works |
| Backend-first, no frontend until protocol works on devnet | On-chain programs are source of truth; frontend is just a client | ✓ Good -- protocol now proven on devnet, frontend is next |
| AMM first in build order | Everything else depends on AMM (pools, swaps); foundation must be solid | ✓ Good -- AMM shipped, 85 tests passing |
| litesvm with type bridge for Anchor 0.32.1 | anchor-litesvm incompatible; manual type conversion works | ✓ Good -- 59 integration tests working |
| PoolType uses 2 behavioral variants | MixedPool/PureT22Pool distinguishes transfer behavior, not protocol pools | ✓ Good -- simpler than 4-variant approach |
| seeds::program for cross-program auth | Carnage PDA must be signed by Epoch Program only | ✓ Good -- unauthorized access provably rejected |
| Synthetix-style cumulative reward-per-token | Industry-standard pattern for gas-efficient proportional distribution | ✓ Good -- 40,000 proptest iterations verify correctness |
| Custom transfer_checked_with_hook | Anchor SPL transfer_checked doesn't forward remaining_accounts | ✓ Good -- manual CPI build works correctly |
| Separate validator per test file | StakePool PDA is singleton; parallel test files need isolated state | ✓ Good -- 4 test files run independently |
| Tax Program epoch_program_id fixed | Was placeholder; updated to real Epoch Program ID | ✓ Good -- all cross-program CPI chains work (v0.7) |
| Feature-flagged Switchboard PID | #[cfg(feature = "devnet")] for compile-time PID selection | ✓ Good -- devnet and mainnet builds cleanly separated |
| CPI passthroughs as AccountInfo | Pool vaults/mints never read by Epoch, only forwarded to Tax | ✓ Good -- resolved BPF stack overflow, 741 bytes saved |
| Independent tax rolls (4 VRF bytes) | Each token gets independent magnitude roll, not shared rate | ✓ Good -- 45 unique rate combos in 50-epoch sample |
| HOOK_ACCOUNTS_PER_MINT = 4 | Token-2022 returns 4 accounts per mint (meta_list, wl_source, wl_dest, hook_program) | ✓ Good -- Sell path remaining_accounts partition correct |
| Protocol-wide Address Lookup Table | Sell path (23+8 accounts) exceeds 1232-byte TX limit | ✓ Good -- 46 addresses cached, v0 TX works |
| VRF timeout recovery over gateway rotation | Each randomness account assigned to specific oracle; rotation doesn't help | ✓ Good -- fresh randomness + retry more reliable |
| Timelock upgrade authority (48-72hr) | Keep upgradeability for SDK/bug fixes, but with user exit window | pending -- deployment policy decision |
| VRF bounty payment deferred | Treasury infrastructure not in current scope; emits 0 | pending -- pre-mainnet |
| Monorepo for frontend | IDLs, PDAs, program IDs, existing scripts all in one repo; no sync overhead | ✓ Good -- npm workspaces + transpilePackages, shared/ consumed by app/ and scripts/ |
| Railway + Postgres for backend | Predictable pricing, everything in one platform, avoids Supabase billing surprises | ✓ Good -- Nixpacks build, Drizzle migrations, health check, live at Railway URL |
| Helius webhooks for price indexing | Low effort, reliable, first-class Solana infrastructure provider | ✓ Good -- webhook receiver parsing 6 event types, OHLCV pipeline to TradingView |
| Frontend tech before design | Build all functionality with throwaway layout; plug in design assets later | ✓ Good -- all 32 requirements satisfied with unstyled but functional UI |
| Custom swap transaction builders | No existing DEX SDK maps to our Tax+AMM+Hook chain; security lives on-chain not in frontend | ✓ Good -- 8 builder functions covering all token pairs, hook resolution |
| Privy in v0.8 (before bonding curves) | Build integration early so it's ready when curves need phone-gated access | ✓ Good initially -- later migrated to @solana/wallet-adapter in v1.1 (Blowfish compatibility + simpler architecture) |
| Zero-dep Sentry over @sentry/nextjs | All @sentry/* packages break Turbopack SSR (monkey-patch webpack/bundle server code) | ✓ Good -- lib/sentry.ts with fetch() to envelope API, works in browser + Node |
| Turbopack over webpack | Faster dev builds, Next.js future direction; required resolveAlias stubs for Node modules | ✓ Good -- 10x faster HMR, worth the polyfill complexity |
| Zero npm deps for visual layer | CSS-only animations avoid Framer Motion/GSAP bundle bloat and Turbopack issues | ✓ Good -- iris animation, slide-up, glow all pure CSS |
| Re-parent components into modals | Keep existing hook logic untouched; only change container/parent elements | ✓ Good -- zero hook regressions across 6 station modals |
| Contain-fit scene scaling | min() CSS function ensures factory fits any viewport with letterbox/pillarbox | ✓ Good -- works 1280-3840px without distortion |
| Iris-open clip-path animation | Dialog-relative coordinate conversion from click origin to modal center | ✓ Good -- visceral "opening a portal" feel |
| Toast via Popover API | popover=manual renders in top layer, above dialog::backdrop blur | ✓ Good -- toasts visible during modal interactions |
| useVisibility hook for data lifecycle | Page Visibility API + modal context gating pauses data fetching when hidden | ✓ Good -- 87% RPC credit reduction |
| SplashScreen over WelcomeModal | User preferred animated brass gear intro gate over localStorage-gated text dialog | ✓ Good -- more visceral, brand-establishing first impression |
| Tooltips removed | User decided glow hover provides sufficient interactive affordance | ✓ Good -- cleaner visual, less clutter |
| Postgres-backed Carnage events | /api/carnage-events replaces client-side RPC parsing, saves ~900 credits/hr | ✓ Good -- faster, cheaper, more reliable |
| Mobile CSS-only responsive | display swap via @media width < 64rem, no JS viewport detection | ✓ Good -- works in SSR, no hydration mismatch |
| 9-slice CSS border for kit frames | Dual-mode Frame (CSS-only with border-radius, asset-based with border-image) | ✓ Good -- covers both rounded and rectangular needs |
| Component kit built upfront | Phase 60 foundation consumed by all subsequent phases (61-69) | ✓ Good -- consistent primitives, zero per-phase rework |
| HTMLAudioElement streaming over AudioBuffer | Avoids 118MB decoded PCM; streaming plays immediately | ✓ Good -- fast load, low memory |
| SettingsProvider as preference hub | Single React context for slippage, priority, audio — localStorage persistence | ✓ Good -- one source of truth, no state desync |
| Phase 66 Documentation deferred | Protocol mechanics not finalized, documenting now would create stale docs | ✓ Good -- saves rework |
| SFX triggers deferred from Phase 68 | Background music is higher impact; SFX can layer on later | ✓ Good -- ships audio value without blocking |
| Two-pass deploy pattern | Feature-flagged programs need mint addresses; init mints first, rebuild, re-deploy | ✓ Good -- solved chicken-and-egg |
| deploy-all.sh pipeline | Automated Phase 0-4 with auto-detection of cluster URL | ✓ Good -- repeatable deployments |
| Buy+sell bonding curves with 15% sell tax | Original spec was buy-only; adding sells creates richer price discovery and the sell tax funds carnage on success or refunds on failure | ✓ Good -- 13.5M proptest iterations prove solvency; sell tax creates meaningful carnage/refund pool |
| Separate tax escrow from curve reserves | Curve reserves = ∫₀^supply P(x)dx deterministically; tax tracked separately for conditional routing (carnage vs refund) | ✓ Good -- clean separation enables correct refund math and carnage routing |
| Both curves must graduate (coupled) | Creates coordination game; neither pool seeds unless both curves fill within 48hrs | ✓ Good -- 48hr deadline + permissionless triggers create fair coordination |
| Open access (no whitelist) | Privy removed in v1.1; open access for now, sybil resistance deferred | ✓ Good -- 20M per-wallet cap is sole sybil resistance; simpler UX |
| CurveState single PDA (no ParticipantState) | ATA balance reads replace per-user PDA; eliminates account bloat | ✓ Good -- simpler, cheaper, no cleanup needed |
| Multi-TX graduation (not monolithic) | Avoids 1232-byte TX limit; uses existing AMM/vault instructions via orchestration script | ✓ Good -- idempotent checkpoint/resume pattern |
| Ceil-rounded tax (protocol-favored) | (sol * 1500 + 9999) / 10000 ensures rounding never shorts the protocol | ✓ Good -- 1-lamport rounding always favors vault solvency |
| Authority hardening (Phase 78) | Prevent front-running of program initialization; single security model under Squads multisig | ✓ Good -- all 7 programs gated; see Authority Map below |
| No emergency pause | Admin pause perceived as rug pull vector; timelocked multisig upgrade is the safety net | ✓ Good -- community trust preserved |
| Hard error on insufficient staking claim | Partial claims create confusing UX; fail-fast is simpler | ✓ Good -- clear error, user retries when funds available |
| Carnage shared module extraction | 1800 lines duplicated across execute_carnage.rs and execute_carnage_atomic.rs | ✓ Good -- CU profile unchanged (binary size identical) |
| Borsh serialization test over offset_of! | #[repr(C)] alignment padding differs from Borsh packed layout | ✓ Good -- tests verify actual on-chain behavior |
| Webhook+SSE over polling | 30s polling wasteful; Helius webhooks + server-sent events for real-time data | ✓ Good -- immediate updates, lower RPC usage |
| GitHub Actions CI (2 parallel jobs) | Rust + TypeScript tests on every push to main | ✓ Good -- catches regressions automatically |
| Code-first spec rewrites | Specs must describe actual code, not stale design intent | ✓ Good -- 4 core specs verified against program source |
| Vault solvency pre-transfer buffer | BOK formal verification identified sell edge case needing guard | ✓ Good -- constant buffer prevents race condition |

### Authority Map

Every program authority, its type, current holder, and burn plan.

| Program | Authority Type | Mechanism | Current Holder | Burn Plan |
|---------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| AMM | Upgrade Authority | BPF Loader ProgramData | Deployer wallet | Transfer to 2-of-3 Squads multisig (v1.4). Never burn. |
| AMM | Admin PDA (AdminConfig) | has_one = admin | Deployer wallet | Transfer to Squads multisig. Burn when ready, no timeline. |
| Transfer Hook | Upgrade Authority | BPF Loader ProgramData | Deployer wallet | Transfer to Squads multisig (v1.4). Never burn. |
| Transfer Hook | Whitelist Authority (WhitelistAuthority PDA) | authority = Some(signer) | Deployer wallet | Transfer to Squads multisig. Burn when whitelist is final. |
| Tax Program | Upgrade Authority | BPF Loader ProgramData | Deployer wallet | Transfer to Squads multisig (v1.4). Never burn. |
| Epoch Program | Upgrade Authority | BPF Loader ProgramData | Deployer wallet | Transfer to Squads multisig (v1.4). Never burn. |
| Staking | Upgrade Authority | BPF Loader ProgramData | Deployer wallet | Transfer to Squads multisig (v1.4). Never burn. |
| Conversion Vault | Upgrade Authority | BPF Loader ProgramData | Deployer wallet | Transfer to Squads multisig (v1.4). Never burn. |
| Bonding Curve | Upgrade Authority | BPF Loader ProgramData | Deployer wallet | Transfer to Squads multisig (v1.4). Never burn. |
| Bonding Curve | Admin PDA (BcAdminConfig) | has_one = authority | Deployer wallet | Transfer to Squads multisig. Burn when curves graduated. |

**Lifecycle strategy:** All authorities (upgrade + admin PDAs) transfer to a single 2-of-3 Squads multisig with 48-72hr timelock (v1.4 scope, MN-01). Upgrade authorities are never burned -- preserves ability to fix bugs via timelocked upgrade. Admin PDAs can be burned individually when their function is no longer needed (e.g., BcAdminConfig after both curves graduate).

**No emergency pause:** Decided against admin-triggered pause mechanism. An admin pause key would be perceived as a rug pull vector by the community. Program upgrade via timelocked multisig is the safety net for critical bugs.
