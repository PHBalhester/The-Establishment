# Project Milestones: Dr. Fraudsworth's Finance Factory

## v1.3 Protocol Hardening & Polish (Shipped: 2026-03-12)

**Delivered:** Every audit finding closed, every program security-hardened, frontend polished for mainnet, documentation rewritten — the protocol is fully finished and ready for v1.4 (final devnet lifecycle test + mainnet deployment).

**Phases completed:** 78-90.1 (16 phases, 45 plans)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Authority hardening across all 7 programs — BcAdminConfig PDA with burnable admin, ProgramData upgrade authority gating on all 5 non-BC programs, authority map with gradual burn timeline documented in PROJECT.md
- Financial safety guards — rent-exempt drain prevention on staking escrow and epoch vault, AMM sell floor propagation, partial fill assertions, vault solvency pre-transfer buffer constant
- Defense-in-depth — pool reader ownership verification, checked u128-to-u64 casts replacing silent truncation, EpochState 64-byte reserved padding with `#[repr(C)]` layout stability, compile-time mainnet placeholder guards (`compile_error!`)
- Carnage refactor + VRF hardening — 1800-line deduplication into shared `carnage_execution.rs`, stale-VRF TOCTOU recovery, binary offset consolidation, crank mainnet-readiness (configurable epoch slots, balance alerting, circuit breaker, spending cap)
- Frontend hardening — RPC proxy protecting API keys, webhook+SSE real-time data pipeline replacing 30s polling, dynamic Helius priority fees, environment-aware cluster config with vanity mainnet mint addresses
- Mobile polish — full responsive pass across all station modals and launch page, mobile wallet adapter with deep-link connection for Phantom/Solflare/Backpack, staking modal eligible unstake display
- Full test coverage sweep + CI/CD — dual-curve LiteSVM integration tests (one-sided fill, grace period, multi-refund, insolvency), edge case audit across all 7 programs, proptest regression fix, GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- Documentation overhaul — 4 core spec rewrites (Carnage, Epoch, Tax, Transfer Hook), Nextra site rewritten page-by-page, bonding curve math proofs with solvency assertion scope, dual-curve state machine edge case documentation
