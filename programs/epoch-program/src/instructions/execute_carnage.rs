//! execute_carnage instruction (fallback).
//!
//! Permissionless fallback Carnage execution within the 300-slot deadline window.
//! Called when atomic execution in consume_randomness fails.
//!
//! This instruction performs the same execution logic as execute_carnage_atomic
//! but can be called by anyone AFTER the 50-slot atomic lock window expires
//! and BEFORE the 300-slot deadline. Fallback cannot execute during the
//! 50-slot atomic-only window (CarnageLockActive error).
//!
//! The SOL->WSOL wrap calls (system_program::transfer + sync_native) execute
//! BEFORE the swap at CPI depth 0, so they do NOT impact the swap depth chain.
