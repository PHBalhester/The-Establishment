//! execute_carnage_atomic instruction.
//!
//! Public instruction for Carnage execution bundled with consume_randomness.
//! Safe to include in every reveal+consume TX for atomic Carnage bundling --
//! no-ops gracefully when carnage_pending is false.
//! Executes burn/sell + buy operations based on EpochState pending fields.
//!
//! CRITICAL CPI DEPTH: The swap path is exactly at Solana's limit:
//!   execute_carnage_atomic (entry) -> Tax::swap_exempt (1)
//!   -> AMM::swap_sol_pool (2) -> Token-2022::transfer_checked (3)
//!   -> Transfer Hook::execute (4) -- SOLANA LIMIT
//!
//! DO NOT add any CPI calls to the swap path.
//!
//! The SOL->WSOL wrap calls (system_program::transfer + sync_native) execute
//! BEFORE the swap at CPI depth 0, so they do NOT impact the swap depth chain.
