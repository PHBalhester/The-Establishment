//! Dr. Fraudsworth Staking Program
//!
//! This program implements PROFIT token staking for SOL yield distribution.
//! Users stake PROFIT to earn a share of the protocol's SOL revenue, distributed
//! pro-rata using the battle-tested cumulative reward-per-token pattern (Synthetix/Quarry).
//!
//! Key features:
//! - Instant unstake (no lockup period)
//! - Separate claim instruction (no forced unstake to harvest)
//! - First-depositor attack mitigation via MINIMUM_STAKE dead stake
//! - Flash loan resistant (stake/unstake same epoch = zero rewards)
//!
//! Instructions:
//! - `initialize_stake_pool`: Create global state (once at deployment)
//! - `stake`: Stake PROFIT tokens to begin earning
//! - `unstake`: Withdraw staked PROFIT + claim pending rewards
//! - `claim`: Claim pending SOL rewards without unstaking
//! - `deposit_rewards`: Called by Tax Program to deposit yield portion
//! - `update_cumulative`: Called by Epoch Program to finalize epoch rewards
//!
