//! Error codes for the staking program.
//!
//! This module defines all error variants following the ERR-XX naming
//! convention from the spec. Errors are organized by category:
//! - Validation errors (input checking)
//! - Authorization errors (access control)
//! - Arithmetic errors (math safety)
//! - State errors (invalid state transitions)
//!
//! Source: Docs/New_Yield_System_Spec.md Section 11
