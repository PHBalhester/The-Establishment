## Common Remediation Patterns in Audit Reports

### What Auditors Recommend Most Often

1. **Use Anchor constraints** — `#[account(has_one, constraint, seeds)]` instead of manual checks
2. **Use `checked_*` arithmetic** — `checked_add`, `checked_mul`, `checked_div`, `checked_sub`
3. **Validate all oracle data** — staleness, confidence, sanity bounds
4. **Add slippage protection** — `min_amount_out` on every user-facing operation
5. **Use canonical PDA bumps** — `ctx.bumps.account_name` not instruction arguments
6. **Validate CPI targets** — check `program_id` matches expected program
7. **Add timelock to admin operations** — minimum 24-48 hour delay
8. **Use `Interface<TokenInterface>`** — support both Token and Token-2022
9. **Add circuit breakers** — pause on extreme price movements or unusual activity
10. **Emit events for critical operations** — enables monitoring and incident response

## Notable Competitive Audits

### Code4rena Solana Foundation (Aug-Sep 2025)
- **Scope:** Token-2022 program (extensions), zk-sdk (ZK ElGamal stack), ZK ElGamal Proof Program
- **Duration:** 33 days, $203,500 USDC total awards
- **Result:** **NO High or Medium severity vulnerabilities found** — 7 Low reports only
- **Context:** Triggered by two ZK ElGamal proof forgery bugs (Apr + Jun 2025); comprehensive community audit of the fixed code
- **Takeaway:** Post-fix code passed rigorous community audit, but the ZK ElGamal bugs were found by solo researchers (LonelySloth, zksecurity), not competitive audits — highlighting value of both approaches
