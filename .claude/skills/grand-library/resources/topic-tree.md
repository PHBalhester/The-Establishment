  General-purpose topic tree for software project interviews.
  Domain packs extend this with domain-specific branches.
  The survey phase may add project-specific topics based on discovery.

# General-Purpose Topic Tree

## How This Tree Works

- Topics are walked **top-down** during the interview
- **Pruning:** When the user's answer makes a subtopic irrelevant, skip it entirely
- **Branching:** When the user's answer reveals complexity, ask follow-up questions
- **Extension points:** Marked with `[DOMAIN_PACK]` — domain packs insert branches here
- Each topic maps to one or more documents in the DOC_MANIFEST

## Tree

## Pruning Rules

| User Says | Skip |
|-----------|------|
| "No frontend" or "CLI only" | Frontend/Client subtree (ask 0 questions) |
| "No smart contracts" | On-Chain subtree entirely |
| "Simple CRUD app" | Reduce Architecture to 2-3 questions |
| "Solo project" | Reduce Security/Access Control to basics |
| "No external services" | External Integrations subtree |

## Creative Doc Triggers

During the interview, watch for these signals to suggest non-obvious documents:

| Signal | Suggest |
|--------|---------|
| Complex permission model | "Admin Emergency Procedures" doc |
| External API dependency | "Service Degradation Playbook" |
| Multi-step deployment | "Deployment Runbook" |
| Migration from existing system | "Migration Strategy & Rollback Plan" |
| Financial / value transfer | "Economic Edge Cases Analysis" |
| Multi-user concurrent access | "Concurrency & Race Condition Catalog" |
