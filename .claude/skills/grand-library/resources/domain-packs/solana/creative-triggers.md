## Fork Opportunity Triggers

Signals that the builder is describing functionality with existing open source precedent. When detected, offer to show matching repos from the catalogue before continuing the interview.

**Interviewer behavior:** When a signal below is detected, pause and say:
> "There are battle-tested open source repos you could fork instead of building from scratch. Want me to show you the options before we continue designing?"

If yes, load the matching `repos-*.md` catalogue file, run a live research check (recent commits, vulnerabilities), and present options with trade-offs. If no, continue the interview as normal.
