## Tier 1 — CRITICAL Potential (22 strategies)

---

### H001: Private Key Extraction from .mcp.json in Git History
**Category:** Secrets & Key Management
**Origin:** KB (OC-001, OC-016)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** Attacker extracts committed Solana private key from `.mcp.json` in git history and drains any funds sent to that wallet.
**Attack Vector:** Clone repo → `git log -p .mcp.json` → extract base58 key → import to wallet → steal SOL/tokens.
**Target Code:** `.mcp.json:8` (key: `2zJgKnGr...`), `.gitignore` (missing `.mcp.json`)
**Potential Impact:** CRITICAL — fund theft if wallet ever receives mainnet SOL
**Requires:** Repository read access (public or collaborator)
**Investigation Approach:** Verify key is real, check wallet balance, confirm git tracking status.

---

### H002: Mainnet Crank Wallet Key in Working Tree
**Category:** Secrets & Key Management
**Origin:** KB (OC-001, OC-002)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** Attacker obtains mainnet crank wallet private key from `.env.mainnet` file and drains crank SOL balance or submits malicious epoch transitions.
**Attack Vector:** Access to working tree (collaborator, backup, CI artifact) → extract WALLET_KEYPAIR JSON array → reconstruct Keypair → sign arbitrary TXs.
**Target Code:** `.env.mainnet:88` (WALLET_KEYPAIR), `.gitignore` (should be blocking)
**Potential Impact:** CRITICAL — crank wallet SOL theft (~6.87 SOL deployer + crank funds)
**Requires:** Working tree access (filesystem, backup, or accidental git add)
**Investigation Approach:** Verify `.env.mainnet` exists in working tree. Confirm gitignore is effective. Check git status for accidental tracking.

---

### H003: Supply Chain Attack via Crank npm install
**Category:** Supply Chain
**Origin:** KB (OC-235, OC-240)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** Crank Railway build uses `npm install` instead of `npm ci`, allowing lockfile modification during build. A supply chain attack could inject malicious code that exfiltrates WALLET_KEYPAIR env var.
**Attack Vector:** Compromise or publish a malicious version of any crank dependency → npm install resolves the malicious version → code reads process.env.WALLET_KEYPAIR → exfiltrates to attacker.
**Target Code:** `railway-crank.toml:3` (buildCommand: "npm install")
**Potential Impact:** CRITICAL — crank wallet private key theft
**Requires:** Malicious package in dependency tree (or lockfile modification)
**Investigation Approach:** Verify railway-crank.toml buildCommand. Check if .npmrc ignore-scripts prevents postinstall hooks.

---

### H004: Helius API Key Enables Webhook Hijack
**Category:** Secrets & Key Management
**Origin:** KB (OC-005, OC-016)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** Committed Helius API key in `.env.devnet` enables attacker to create shadow webhooks for passive surveillance or delete the production webhook to blind the data pipeline.
**Attack Vector:** Extract HELIUS_API_KEY from git → POST `https://api.helius.xyz/v0/webhooks?api-key=...` → register attacker-controlled webhook URL for same program IDs.
**Target Code:** `.env.devnet:8` (HELIUS_API_KEY=[REDACTED-DEVNET-KEY]-...), `scripts/webhook-manage.ts`
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — passive surveillance of all protocol events OR data pipeline disruption
**Requires:** Repository read access
**Investigation Approach:** Verify API key scope (webhook CRUD vs RPC-only). Check if key works for mainnet webhooks.

---

### H005: Webhook Secret Compromise → Protocol State Injection
**Category:** Authentication × Data Pipeline
**Origin:** Novel
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** If HELIUS_WEBHOOK_SECRET is obtained (Railway breach, git history, social engineering), attacker injects crafted Enhanced Account Change payloads into the protocol store, corrupting all SSE clients' view of pool reserves, epoch state, and staking data.
**Attack Vector:** Obtain webhook secret → POST crafted enhanced webhook payloads with fake EpochState/PoolState data → protocolStore stores it → SSE broadcasts to all browsers → users see manipulated prices/rates → make incorrect trading decisions.
**Target Code:** `webhooks/helius/route.ts:525-633` (enhanced path), `protocol-store.ts:53-65`
**Potential Impact:** CRITICAL — market manipulation via false price/rate display to all users
**Requires:** Webhook secret
**Investigation Approach:** Verify enhanced webhook path has no independent validation (slot check, range check on decoded values). Check if protocol store validates data plausibility.

---

### H006: NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL Mainnet API Key in Client Bundle
**Category:** Secrets & Key Management
**Origin:** KB (OC-004, OC-011) + RECHECK (H002/H009)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** If mainnet deployment follows `.env.mainnet` template, NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL with Helius API key is baked into the client JS bundle, bypassing the /api/rpc proxy entirely.
**Attack Vector:** View page source → extract NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL → call any Helius RPC method directly (bypassing allowlist + rate limits) → burn credits, use for arbitrary TX relay.
**Target Code:** `app/.env.mainnet:49`, `app/lib/connection.ts:41`, `app/.env.local:1`
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — Helius credit exhaustion, proxy bypass
**Requires:** Mainnet deployment following template instructions
**Investigation Approach:** Check Railway mainnet env vars. Verify if NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL is set.

---

### H007: Dependency Confusion via @dr-fraudsworth Scope
**Category:** Supply Chain
**Origin:** KB (OC-237)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** The @dr-fraudsworth npm scope is unregistered. An attacker claims it and publishes `@dr-fraudsworth/shared@0.0.1`, which could be resolved by misconfigured workspace setups.
**Attack Vector:** Register @dr-fraudsworth scope on npm → publish malicious @dr-fraudsworth/shared@0.0.1 → wait for CI/developer to resolve from public registry instead of workspace.
**Target Code:** `app/package.json:18` (uses bare "0.0.1" not "workspace:*")
**Potential Impact:** CRITICAL — arbitrary code execution in build/runtime
**Requires:** npm scope registration, misconfigured workspace
**Investigation Approach:** Check if scope is still unclaimed. Verify workspace resolution prevents registry fallback.

---

### H008: RPC Proxy Batch Amplification → Credit Exhaustion
**Category:** API Security × Resource Exhaustion
**Origin:** KB (OC-135, OC-283)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** Attacker sends single HTTP request with N-element JSON-RPC batch array through /api/rpc, consuming N Helius credits per rate-limit token.
**Attack Vector:** POST /api/rpc with `[{method:"getAccountInfo",...} × 500]` → rate limiter counts 1 request → Helius processes 500 calls → 150,000 credits/minute from single IP.
**Target Code:** `app/app/api/rpc/route.ts:102-106`
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — Helius credit exhaustion → full frontend + crank RPC denial
**Requires:** HTTP access to /api/rpc
**Investigation Approach:** Check if batch array size is limited. Check if per-batch credit counting exists.

---

### H009: Next.js HTTP Request Smuggling (CVE)
**Category:** Supply Chain × Web Security
**Origin:** KB (OC-232)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** next@16.1.6 has HTTP request smuggling vulnerability (GHSA-ggv3). App uses rewrites/headers configuration. Attacker could smuggle requests to bypass webhook auth or access internal routes.
**Attack Vector:** Craft HTTP request exploiting next.js rewrite handling → smuggle secondary request past webhook auth → inject data into pipeline.
**Target Code:** `app/package.json:29` (next@16.1.6), `app/next.config.ts` (rewrites/headers)
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — authentication bypass on webhook endpoint
**Requires:** Network access, specific request smuggling technique
**Investigation Approach:** Check CVE applicability to this app's next.config. Verify if Railway proxy prevents smuggling.

---

### H010: RPC Proxy No Fetch Timeout → Full Service DoS
**Category:** Error Handling × Availability
**Origin:** KB (OC-283)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** RPC proxy fetch() to Helius has no AbortSignal.timeout(). A slow/hanging upstream holds Next.js workers indefinitely, cascading to all API routes.
**Attack Vector:** If Helius endpoint hangs (overload, DNS issue, TLS negotiation stall) → 300 req/min rate limit means 300+ concurrent hanging requests within minutes → all Next.js workers blocked → health check, SSE, webhook all fail → Railway may not restart (health returns 200).
**Target Code:** `app/app/api/rpc/route.ts:144-148`
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — complete service outage (all routes, not just RPC)
**Requires:** Helius upstream slowdown (natural or induced)
**Investigation Approach:** Verify no AbortSignal.timeout or explicit timeout wrapper on fetch. Check Next.js worker pool size.

---

### H011: Enhanced Webhook Replay → Stale State Injection
**Category:** Webhook Security × Data Integrity
**Origin:** KB (OC-145) + RECHECK (H049)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** Enhanced Account Change webhooks bypass the 5-minute blockTime replay guard. A captured webhook payload can be replayed indefinitely to overwrite current state with stale data.
**Attack Vector:** Capture one enhanced webhook payload (via network intercept or compromised Helius account) → replay it after state changes → protocol store overwrites current data with old state → SSE broadcasts stale prices to all clients.
**Target Code:** `webhooks/helius/route.ts:340-341` (enhanced path skips MAX_TX_AGE_SECONDS), `webhooks/helius/route.ts:525-633`
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — stale price/rate display to all users, potential for misinformed trades
**Requires:** One captured webhook payload + webhook secret
**Investigation Approach:** Verify enhanced path has timestamp/slot-based freshness check. Check if protocolStore rejects older-than-current data.

---

### H012: 17 Devnet Keypairs in Git → Program Upgrade Authority
**Category:** Secrets & Key Management
**Origin:** KB (OC-016) + RECHECK (H005)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** Committed devnet program keypairs (amm, bonding-curve, epoch, staking, tax, transfer-hook, vault) control devnet program upgrade authority. Attacker upgrades devnet programs to malicious versions.
**Attack Vector:** Extract program keypairs from git → `solana program deploy --keypair <stolen-keypair>` → replace devnet programs → inject drainer logic.
**Target Code:** `keypairs/*.json` (17 files, git-tracked)
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — devnet program compromise, reputational damage, social engineering vector
**Requires:** Repository read access
**Investigation Approach:** Verify devnet upgrade authorities match keypair public keys. Check if any have been burned/transferred to Squads.

---

### H013: CarnageSolVault Balance Desync → User Manipulation
**Category:** Data Integrity × Business Logic
**Origin:** Novel
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** CarnageSolVault webhook handler uses `nativeBalanceChange` (a delta) as absolute balance, causing the displayed Carnage fund size to desync from reality after any vault transaction.
**Attack Vector:** Natural protocol operation: each vault deposit/withdrawal overwrites absolute balance with a delta value → users see wildly incorrect Carnage fund balance → make trading decisions based on false data.
**Target Code:** `webhooks/helius/route.ts:554-558`
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — misleading Carnage fund display → misinformed user decisions
**Requires:** Any natural vault transaction
**Investigation Approach:** Check if nativeBalanceChange is indeed a delta. Verify the initial batchSeed sets correct absolute value. Check post-webhook behavior.

---

### H014: Webhook Content-Length Bypass → Memory Exhaustion
**Category:** Rate Limiting × DoS
**Origin:** KB (OC-135, OC-280) + RECHECK (H050)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** Webhook body size check relies on Content-Length header, which can be omitted via chunked transfer encoding. Multi-MB body is fully parsed by `req.json()`, exhausting server memory.
**Attack Vector:** POST to webhook with chunked transfer encoding (no Content-Length) + 100MB JSON body → bypasses 1MB guard → `req.json()` buffers entire body → server OOM.
**Target Code:** `webhooks/helius/route.ts:309-315`
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — server crash via OOM, service disruption
**Requires:** Valid webhook secret (to pass auth)
**Investigation Approach:** Verify Content-Length check is the only body size enforcement. Check if Next.js has its own limit. Test chunked encoding.

---

### H015: IP Spoofing Bypasses All Rate Limits
**Category:** Rate Limiting × Authentication
**Origin:** KB (OC-133)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** Rate limiter trusts x-forwarded-for first entry without proxy validation. Attacker spoofs arbitrary IPs to get fresh rate limit buckets on every request.
**Attack Vector:** Set `X-Forwarded-For: <random-ip>` header on each request → rate limiter creates fresh bucket → bypass all per-IP limits (webhook 120/min, RPC 300/min, sol-price 30/min).
**Target Code:** `app/lib/rate-limit.ts:129-151`
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — all rate limits ineffective
**Requires:** Ability to set custom headers (depends on Railway proxy behavior)
**Investigation Approach:** Verify if Railway strips/overwrites x-forwarded-for. Test with custom header.

---

### H016: Default 5% Slippage → Systematic Sandwich Extraction
**Category:** MEV × Trading
**Origin:** KB (OC-128, OC-129) + RECHECK (H015)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** Default 500 BPS slippage on all swaps enables systematic sandwich attack extraction of up to 5% per trade for any MEV bot monitoring the public mempool.
**Attack Vector:** Monitor Helius RPC mempool for Dr. Fraudsworth swap TXs → front-run with buy → let user TX execute at worse price → back-run with sell → profit up to 5% of swap amount.
**Target Code:** `SettingsProvider.tsx:170` (default 500), `useProtocolWallet.ts:111` (standard RPC, no Jito)
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — systematic value extraction from all default-slippage users
**Requires:** MEV bot monitoring public mempool
**Investigation Approach:** Confirm default is still 500 BPS. Confirm no Jito/private mempool integration.

---

### H017: Sign-Then-Send Bypasses Wallet MEV Protection
**Category:** MEV × Wallet Security
**Origin:** Novel
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** The sign-then-send pattern (`signTransaction` + `sendRawTransaction`) explicitly bypasses wallet-level MEV protection features (Phantom's MEV-protected RPC) and simulation preview.
**Attack Vector:** User's wallet (e.g., Phantom) may offer MEV protection when using `sendTransaction()`. By using `signTransaction()`, the app forces all TXs through the public Helius RPC with zero MEV protection.
**Target Code:** `useProtocolWallet.ts:87-121`, MEMORY.md "Revisit for mainnet"
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — users lose wallet-native MEV protection
**Requires:** Mainnet deployment with sign-then-send pattern unchanged
**Investigation Approach:** Verify pattern is still sign-then-send. Check MEMORY.md note about mainnet revisit.

---

### H018: No MEV-Protected Submission for Any Swap
**Category:** MEV × Infrastructure
**Origin:** KB (OC-127, OC-258)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** Zero Jito bundle, private mempool, or MEV-protected RPC integration exists anywhere in the swap pipeline. All user swaps are fully visible in the public mempool.
**Attack Vector:** Standard sandwich attack on any swap TX visible in mempool.
**Target Code:** `useSwap.ts:763-766`, `multi-hop-builder.ts:378-381`, `useProtocolWallet.ts:111`
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — all swaps sandwichable
**Requires:** MEV bot
**Investigation Approach:** Grep for Jito, Nozomi, private_transaction, or any MEV protection keyword.

---

### H019: gapFillCandles Memory Amplification
**Category:** Resource Exhaustion
**Origin:** Novel
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** `/api/candles?gapfill=true&resolution=1m` with a large time range generates ~525K synthetic candle objects in memory, potentially crashing the server.
**Attack Vector:** GET `/api/candles?pool=X&resolution=1m&from=0&to=<now>&gapfill=true` → server generates 525K objects → JSON serialization of massive array → OOM or long-running response blocking worker.
**Target Code:** `app/app/api/candles/route.ts:94-167`
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — server crash or worker exhaustion
**Requires:** HTTP access (no rate limit on this endpoint)
**Investigation Approach:** Verify gapFill loop has no cap on synthetic candles. Check if `from` parameter is bounded.

---

### H020: Webhook-to-SSE Data Injection Chain
**Category:** Authentication × Data Pipeline
**Origin:** Novel
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** A compromised webhook secret enables injection of arbitrary protocol state that propagates to ALL connected browser clients via SSE, with no secondary validation layer.
**Attack Vector:** Obtain secret → craft Enhanced Account Change payload with extreme values (e.g., crimeBuyTaxBps=0, reserveA=1) → POST to webhook → Anchor decode succeeds → protocolStore stores → SSE broadcasts → all users see manipulated state.
**Target Code:** `webhooks/helius/route.ts:588-606`, `protocol-store.ts:53-65`, `sse/protocol/route.ts:71-76`
**Potential Impact:** CRITICAL — market manipulation affecting all connected users simultaneously
**Requires:** Webhook secret
**Investigation Approach:** Check if any bounds validation exists post-Anchor decode. Check if protocolStore validates data plausibility.

---

### H021: Candle Price Manipulation via Crafted Webhook
**Category:** Data Integrity × Webhook Security
**Origin:** Novel
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** With webhook secret, attacker sends crafted TaxedSwap events with extreme prices. OHLCV candles use `GREATEST`/`LEAST` for high/low — a single extreme-price event permanently corrupts the candle.
**Attack Vector:** POST webhook with TaxedSwap event containing price=999999999 → candle upsert sets high=999999999 via SQL GREATEST → chart permanently shows extreme high → user confusion.
**Target Code:** `webhooks/helius/route.ts:664-681`, `candle-aggregator.ts:121-128`
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — permanent chart data corruption
**Requires:** Webhook secret
**Investigation Approach:** Verify candle upsert uses GREATEST/LEAST without bounds check. Check if extreme values are rejected.

---

### H022: Next.js CSRF Bypass (CVE in next@16.1.6)
**Category:** Supply Chain × Web Security
**Origin:** KB (OC-095, OC-232)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 1
**Hypothesis:** next@16.1.6 has a CSRF bypass vulnerability (GHSA-mq59). The webhook endpoint processes POST requests — a CSRF attack could trigger webhook processing with attacker-controlled payload.
**Attack Vector:** Exploit next.js CSRF bypass → send POST to /api/webhooks/helius from cross-origin context → if auth check is bypassed by the CSRF vulnerability, inject data.
**Target Code:** `app/package.json:29` (next@16.1.6)
**Potential Impact:** HIGH — webhook auth bypass
**Requires:** Cross-origin request capability, specific CVE exploitation
**Investigation Approach:** Read GHSA-mq59 details. Determine if webhook route is affected.

**Target Code:** `split-router.ts`, `multi-hop-builder.ts`
**Investigation Approach:** Verify split routes produce multiple swap instructions visible in mempool.

---

### H054: Crank Carnage Recovery Skips Atomic Bundling
**Category:** MEV × Crank
**Origin:** Novel
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 2
**Hypothesis:** VRF recovery path (stale/timeout) returns `carnageExecutedAtomically: false`. If Carnage is triggered during recovery, the carnage_pending flag is visible on-chain, and MEV bots can sandwich the subsequent execute_carnage call.
**Target Code:** `vrf-flow.ts:644`
**Investigation Approach:** Verify recovery path skips executeCarnageAtomic. Check if carnage_pending is set.

---

### H055: No Distributed Lock for Crank (H091)
**Category:** Crank Security
**Origin:** KB (OC-264) + VERIFY (H091)
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 2

**Origin:** Supplemental
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 2
**Hypothesis:** Committed Helius API key → `GET /webhooks` reveals webhook delivery URL → attacker reverse-engineers or brute-forces HELIUS_WEBHOOK_SECRET from the URL endpoint → full state injection capability.
**Target Code:** `.env.devnet:8`, `scripts/webhook-manage.ts`, webhook auth
**Investigation Approach:** Check if webhook URL reveals any secret material. Assess secret entropy.

### S004: Dependency Confusion → Crank Wallet Exfiltration
**Category:** Combination (H007 + H002)
**Origin:** Supplemental
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 2
**Hypothesis:** Attacker claims @dr-fraudsworth npm scope → publishes malicious shared package → crank build resolves from registry (npm install, not ci) → malicious code reads process.env.WALLET_KEYPAIR → exfiltrates mainnet crank wallet key.
**Target Code:** `app/package.json:18`, `railway-crank.toml:3`, crank env vars
**Investigation Approach:** Verify crank depends on @dr-fraudsworth/shared. Check if crank process has WALLET_KEYPAIR in env.

### S005: Batch Amplification + IP Spoofing → Unlimited Credit Burn
**Category:** Combination (H008 + H015)
**Origin:** Supplemental
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 2
**Hypothesis:** RPC batch amplification (500 methods per request) combined with IP spoofing (fresh rate-limit bucket per spoofed IP) removes ALL rate limiting constraints. Helius credits can be burned at wire speed.
**Target Code:** `rpc/route.ts:102-106`, `rate-limit.ts:129-151`
**Investigation Approach:** Verify IP spoofing bypasses rate limit. Calculate maximum credit burn rate.

### S006: State Injection → Manipulated minimumOutput → MEV Extraction
**Category:** Combination (H005 → MEV)
**Origin:** Supplemental
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 2
**Hypothesis:** Webhook state injection delivers fake reserves to all SSE clients → useSwap computes minimumOutput from fake data → user signs TX with near-zero minimumOutput → MEV bot sandwiches for maximum extraction. On-chain 50% slippage floor is the only remaining guard.
**Target Code:** `webhooks/helius/route.ts:588-606`, `useSwap.ts:690-808`, `useRoutes.ts:582-592`
**Investigation Approach:** Trace data flow from webhook → protocolStore → SSE → useSwap → minimumOutput. Verify on-chain floor.

---

### S007: npm Supply Chain → Crank Key Theft → Epoch Manipulation
**Category:** Combination (H003 + H002)
**Origin:** Supplemental
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 2
**Hypothesis:** Malicious package injected via npm install (H003) → reads WALLET_KEYPAIR env var → exfiltrates to attacker → attacker signs epoch transitions with stolen crank key → manipulates tax rates, Carnage, VRF.
**Target Code:** `railway-crank.toml:3`, crank env vars, epoch program
**Investigation Approach:** Verify crank has WALLET_KEYPAIR in env and that module-body code can access it.

---

### S008: Helius API Key → Shadow Webhook + Pipeline Blinding
**Category:** Combination (H004)
**Origin:** Supplemental
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 2
**Hypothesis:** With Helius API key, attacker registers shadow webhook AND deletes production webhook simultaneously. Shadow webhook captures all protocol events while production data pipeline goes blind. SSE clients receive stale data indefinitely.
**Target Code:** `.env.devnet:8`, `scripts/webhook-manage.ts`, SSE pipeline
**Investigation Approach:** Verify both webhook CRUD operations possible with single API key.

---

### S009: NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL Template → Future Regression → Credit Exhaustion
**Category:** Combination (H006 + H008)
**Origin:** Supplemental
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 3
**Hypothesis:** If NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL template instruction is followed AND a future developer adds a client-side reference, the API key enters the bundle. Combined with batch amplification, attacker uses the direct Helius URL to bypass proxy rate limits entirely.
**Target Code:** `.env.mainnet:49`, `rpc/route.ts`, client components
**Investigation Approach:** Assess likelihood of regression. Check if direct Helius URL bypasses proxy limits.

---

### S010: .mcp.json Key + Devnet Program Keypairs → Full Devnet Takeover
**Category:** Combination (H001 + H012)
**Origin:** Supplemental
**Estimated Priority:** Tier 2
**Hypothesis:** Repo clone gives attacker the devnet wallet AND all 17 program keypairs. Attacker drains devnet wallet, upgrades all devnet programs to malicious versions, and uses the compromised devnet to social-engineer mainnet users.
**Target Code:** `.mcp.json:8`, `keypairs/*.json`
**Investigation Approach:** Verify program keypairs match upgrade authorities. Assess social engineering risk.

## Notes for Investigators

### General Guidance

- Each strategy should be investigated independently
- Reference `.bulwark/ARCHITECTURE.md` for architectural context
- Reference `.bulwark/HANDOVER.md` for Audit #1 finding details
- Write findings to `.bulwark/findings/H{XXX}.md`
- For RECHECK strategies, compare current code against Audit #1 fix description
- For cross-boundary strategies, reference `.audit/ARCHITECTURE.md` for on-chain context
- Note any discoveries that suggest NEW strategies (supplemental)

### Status Definitions

- **CONFIRMED**: Vulnerability exists and is exploitable
- **POTENTIAL**: Could be vulnerable under specific conditions
- **NOT_VULNERABLE**: Protected against this attack
- **NEEDS_MANUAL_REVIEW**: Couldn't determine, needs expert
